I'm a PhD student at the Graphics and Imaging Lab, at the University of Zaragoza. I'm under the supervision of [Diego Gutierrez](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/) and [Adolfo Mu√±oz](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~amunoz). 

My research interests include light transport simulation and forward and inverse rendering, especially involving participating media.
